# ‚ú® Preamble

You are welcome to use or stream the bot in any way you want, including streaming your own 24/7 Prof. Oak challenge streams.

The intent of this bot is not to _cheat_ for shinies or complete the game as fast as possible, but instead to transform generation 3 Pok√©mon games into somewhat of an idle game, stacking up millions of encounters searching for that one encounter, or completing an absurd challenge.

The bot is frame perfect and can _technically_ cheat by reading data from any point in memory and manipulating RNG. By default, it will attempt to perform actions as if a human were playing to make gameplay as representative as possible, some examples:
- Starter Pok√©mon are generated just _1 frame_ after confirming the starter selection, the bot will wait until the battle begins, and the starter Pok√©mon sprite is visible before soft resetting
- It's possible to peek inside un-hatched eggs to view stats and shininess as soon as they're received from the daycare, the bot will wait until the eggs are fully hatched before checking and logging
- Feebas tile locations _could_ be instantly located by reading memory, instead, the bot will attempt to locate the tiles by searching each tile individually
